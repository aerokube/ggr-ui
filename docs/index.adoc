Ggr UI is a standalone daemon that automatically collects `/status` information from multiple https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid[Selenoid] instances and returns it as a single `/status` API. When this daemon is running you can use https://github.com/aerokube/selenoid-ui[Selenoid UI] to see the state of the entire cluster.
